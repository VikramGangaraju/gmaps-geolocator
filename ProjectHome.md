NOTE: This library depends on Google's Maps API for Flash. You must agree to its terms of service and sign up for a Google Maps developer account [here](http://code.google.com/apis/maps/signup.html) and download the Maps SWC to your classpath. Though this library is under the LGPL, the Google Maps API is under a separate license that you must accept to use this library.

The code is in a very fragile state at the moment... I mean like I just created the project and haven't completed writing tests and haven't even taken the library for a go just yet, so have patience. This library will improve in time :)

To download a semi-recent build [click here](http://gmaps-geolocator.googlecode.com/files/gmaps-geolocator-0.1.swc). Otherwise, you should see [Building](Building.md) and [Testing](Testing.md) if you want to play with the source and get your hands dirty.
