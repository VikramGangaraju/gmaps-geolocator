#summary How to run FlexUnit tests on the library

To compile and execute FlexUnit tests on the library, first checkout the library using Subversion:
{{{
mkdir gmaps-geolocator
cd gmaps-geolocator
svn checkout http://gmaps-geolocator.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/gmaps-geolocator
}}}
Then, build the test runner with Ant:
{{{
ant compile.tests
}}}

After the tests have compiled, you may view them by pointing your browser to the location of the tests.swf file.
